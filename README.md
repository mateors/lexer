# lexer

I truly wanted to understand how interpreters work and that included understanding how lexers and parsers work.

## What is an interpreter?
Interpreter: take source code and evaluate it.

> Interpreters that parse the source code, build an *abstract syntax tree (AST)* out of it and then evaluate this tree. This type of interpreter is sometimes called “tree-walking” interpreter, because it “walks” the AST and interprets it.

## What we want?
We build a tree-walking interpreter.

We're going to build our own **lexer**, our own parser, our own tree representation and our own evaluator. We'll see what **tokens** are, what an abstract syntax tree is, how to build such a tree, how to evaluate it and how to extend our language with new data structures and built-in functions.


## Why its important?
Without a compiler or an interpreter a programming language is nothing more than an idea or a specification.

## Parsing Expressions

 ### Prefix operators
 A prefix operator is an operator "in front of" its operand.
 * -5
 * !true
 * !false

### Postfix operators
 A postfix operator is an operator "after" its operand

 ### Infix operators (or "binary operators")
 An infix operator sits between its operands
 * 5 + 5
 * 5 - 5
 * 5 / 5
 * 5 * 5

### We can use parentheses to group expressions and influence the order of evaluation
* 5 * (5 + 5)
* ((5 + 5) * 5) * 5

### There are call expressions:
* add(2, 3)
* add(add(2, 3), add(5, 10))
* max(5, add(5, (5 * 5)))

### Identifiers are expressions too:
* foo * bar / foobar
* add(foo, bar)

## if expressions
* `let result = if (10 > 5) { true } else { false };`
* `result // => true`

*"Pratt Parsing is very simple to understand, trivial to implement, easy to use, extremely effcient in practice if not in theory, yet flexible enough to meet most reasonable syntactic needs of users"*

Top Down Operator Precedence Parsing, or Pratt parsing, was invented as `an alternative to parsers` based on context-free grammars and the Backus-Naur-Form.

And that is also the `main difference`: instead of associating parsing functions with `grammar rules (defined in BNF or EBNF)`, Pratt associates these functions (which he calls `"semantic code"`) with single token types.

A crucial part of this idea is that each token type can have two parsing functions associated with it, depending on the token's position - `infix` or `prefix`.

* The first thing we need to do for expression parsing is to prepare our AST.

> Let statement -> `let x = 5 +5;`

> Expression statement -> `x +5;`


## Implementing the Pratt Parser
A Pratt parser’s main idea is the association of parsing functions *(which Pratt calls "semantic code")* with token types.

Each token type can have up to two parsing functions associated with it, depending on whether the token is found in a prefix or an infix position.

## Prefix operator syntax
> `<prefix operator><expression>;`
*unary expressions*

## Infix operator syntax
> `<expression> <infix operator> <expression>;`
*Because of the two operands (left and right) these expressions are sometimes called "binary expressions"*


## Table-driven testing approach

## Testing our lexer
* `go test ./lexer/`
* `go test ./ast/`
* `go test ./parser/`
* `go test -run TestOperatorPrecedenceParsing ./parser/`
